DEAR SAMSUNG : 
Your USERS OWNERS of NOTE phones loved the removable battery, the removable 
memory, and stylus.
The only thing people wanted was a second Memory slot for full sized SDXC 
cards (now up to 512GB) for video,
larger, longer battery life, and ever increasing better cameras for 4K 
video and even better photography.

For some reason, your MENTALLY DEFECTIVE management decided to poison the 
brand and try to turn
Samsung NOTE - the flagship product, into a glued together generic clone 
copy of an iPhone - STUPID.

IF we wanted glued together junk that is worthless in 2 years - we would 
waste our money on iPhones.

So now your exploding fire bomb glued together NOTes are trash and 
dangerous and banned from airports.

A NOTE 3 phone, with removable battery is infinitely better than a NOTE 7.

HOW ABOUT MAKING A NEW NOTE 8
waterproof internal design, 64GB storage by default, 2 memory slots (one 
microSD, one SDXC), removable battery with double the life of a Note 3 
battery, 4K video and double the photo resolution, night vision camera and 
stereo speakers that actually sound beautiful ?

Samsung: STOP TRYING TO BE A CLONE OF APPLE GARBAGE - you are better than 
Apple. iPhones SUCK.

Oh, and get rid of the Rapid Charge technology that explodes batteries too 
and find a new battery supplier.﻿

شركة سامسونج قدمت الكثير من الأجهزة والتقنيات الجيدة 
معظم الشركات الكبرى أضطرت لإعادة منتجاتها بسبب خلل في التصنيع أو في

لا تعد سابقة في المجال !! 
لذلك رايي أن شركة سامسونج ستواجه هذه الكارثة بقليل من ذكائها لتعود بنسخة 
أفضل بكثير من نوت 7 
وبكل ثقه ستكون قد حصلت على وسيلة تسويق جيدة 
فالمستهلك الآن يريد أن يحصل على جهاز مع درجة أمان عاليه 
وأعتقد أن هذه الميزه التي ستلعب عليها شركة سامسونج في النسخ القادمة من 
جلكسي نوت

After all the Samsung fanboys literally invading Apple videos laughing at a 
few iPhone 6 that bent under the pressure of a 300 pounds man sitting on it 
while it's in their pocket, this is kinda amusing. Although I do not wish 
bad things to any corporations, it's a nice lesson of humility for you, 
kids. There's also a class action lawsuit against Samsung for exploding top 
loader washers. And I own a Note 5.﻿

What a bunch of Korean built junk, like all of Samsung's products. Ever 
wonder why you get a 10 year warranty on a new Hyundai or Kia? That's 
because you need it!! Samsung deserves something like this to happen to 
them after other company's ideas they've ripped off-Apple, Sony, and a 
whole lot more. The sad part is that the people that bought these POS 
phones didn't deserve their car or home being burnt to the ground, or 
putting their families in danger. Shame on you, Samsung!!!﻿

Man this is killing me, I was really going to buy Note 7 after all the 
wuss, waited almost 6 months, been keeping myself update about note 7 from 
the internet, daily reading articles about it on sammobile, android 
authority, pocketnow, watching tons and tons of videos on youtube about it 
before its release. On the day of release I bought popcorns to watch the 
live broadcAST on youtube, that's how excited I was. Still, remember 
youtube was pooping on the day note 7 was released. I knew it then this 
smartphone is a huge success.I was so much excited to get my hands on one. 
Now I can'T believe Note 7 is no more, I feel bad for Samsung and mostly 
for Note 7. :'( :'( :'( i EVEN had a page about Note 7. I am crying inside.﻿
